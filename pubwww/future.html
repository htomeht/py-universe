<h3>Status and Future Plans for PUB</h3></a>
PUB has been sitting unattended for awhile now.  The author
has moved on, and so although it appears to be functional,
it needs to be maintained.  Also, there's almost no documentation,
although there are extensive comments in the source code.
<p>
This being the case, I volunteered to adopt the code and
put up a Source Forge site for it (which is what you
are now looking at).
</p>
<p>
Since this time, 
<a href="mailto:jmacy@users.sourceforge.net">Joshua Macy</a>
has also expressed an interest in
PUB and is currently working on updating PUB to work with
Python 2.0 as well as implementing a version of the
<a href="oz.html#HAP">Hap</a>
character agent architecture originally developed as part of the 
<a href="oz.html">Oz Project</a>
at Carnegie Mellon University.
</p>
<p>
My development plan for PUB is:
<ol>
<li>Test with sample game provided</li>
<li>Fix any Python upgrade problems</li>
<li>Set up Source Forge site</li>
<li>Add doc strings to all classes and methods based on comments</li>
<li>Create automatic documentation using the doc strings</li>
<li>Review code and write architectural design documentation</li>
<li>Adapt the one-room "Alice" tutorial (from Inform) to PUB</li>
<li>Normalize this as PUB version 1.0.x</li>
<li>Package the resulting version for distribution</li>
<li>Begin extending to version 1.1.x (development)</li>
</ol>
This will provide a clean breakpoint for anyone who
wants to do other things with PUB, and we can then
extend it as needed to support character agents and
the AutoManga Presenter. <i>[By the way, I've done
steps 1-4 on this list -- but I haven't had a chance
to start in on the documentation yet (2001-3/31, TJH)]</i>.
</p>
<h3>Enhancements for PUB</h3>
In order to provide hooks for AutoManga, and as general
adaptations of the system, I want to add:
<ul>
<li>
GUI menu-based input.  This follows an interface concept we
discussed for 
<a href="http://light-princess.sourceforge.net">The Light Princess</a>.
The idea is that game play
could be smoother if there were less confusion about what verbs
will be understood by the parser (since it's not realistic to
have a parser that understands full English).  This has been
criticized as the "slippery slope" towards the "Myst" model,
where there's only mouse-controlled input, and essentially
only one verb "click-on-object", which causes all game play
to be driven by defaults.  However, I think there's a broad
middle ground here:  I want to stay fairly close to the IF
side, but with less frustration learning the parsers' vocabulary.
(Later I hope this will be ported to an SDL-based GUI
such as 
<a href="http://www.bms-austria.com/projects/paragui/">ParaGUI</a>).
<p></p>
</li>

<li>
XML File format.  This will involve defining a DTD for
the important design elements (such as rooms and characters).
It is assumed that more complex extensions will involve
programming directly in Python, but this will be used to automate
time-consuming programming task, such as laying out rooms. This is
currently being looked at by <a href="mailto:giem@free.fr">Jm</a>.
<p>
I worked out a method for using the netlister in
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xcircuit">xcircuit</a>
to layout adventure game rooms.  Although I have prototyped
this in principle, I don't have a specific backend for any
particular IF engine in practice. I'm hoping to start with an
XML format.
<p></p>
</li>

<li>
In-Scene modeling.  Limited 3D positioning within a room, to
support the AutoManga scene model -- camera choices, sound
mixing, etc.  This information will be available to 
characters that are within the room and to the presentation
engine (but will be lost when one moves to a new room).
<p></p>
</li>

<li>
Integration with Oz character models.  This seems like an
extension of the "Actor" object within PUB.  This is being
worked on by
<a href="mailto:jmacy@users.sourceforge.net">Joshua Macy</a>.
<p></p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
If this sounds really ambitious -- well, it is.  I don't expect
it to happen tomorrow.  In fact,
I am currently devoting most of my energy to the
multimedia programming in
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/automanga">AutoManga</a>
and the game
<a href="http://light-princess.sourceforge.net">The Light Princess</a>,
but once those are more stable, I expect to spend
some time on PUB! Meanwhile,
<a href="mailto:jmacy@users.sourceforge.net">Joshua Macy</a>
seems to be the leading developer on PUB.
