<h3>Status and Future Plans for PUB</h3></a>
<p>
We had a lot of <a href="old_future.html">Ambitious plans</a> at one time on this
page, but I'm going to leave it open for now. If you are interested
in where PyUniverse/PUB is going, please have a look at the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=10007">Mailing List Archives</a>
where it has been/is being discussed (2004-2).
</p>
<p>
I plan to add a wiki site here to make this go a bit smoother, but I'm currently
having technical problems with installing ZWiki. <tt>:-P</tt>, so please bear
with me (2004-2).
</p>
<p>
Some ideas I still like:
<ul>
<li>XML room format -- it would be nice, for the novice user, for rapid prototyping, and for
xcircuit conversion to create a parser that reads an XML room description file and generates
a "dungeon" in PUB automatically.  I've tinkered with Python's libxml and DOM interface, and
I think I might find some time to do this (looks pretty easy). Should this be a real "Interactive
Fiction Markup Language" as Jm originally called it? I don't know, but it might be useful.
Expert users will continue to want the power of programming PUB in python, though.

</li>
<li>
Oz-like characters.  I'm pretty sure this is possible, but it will require a lot of work!
<br><br>
</li>
<li>
Some form of graphical front-end integration. I think the Blender option probably represents
the most impact for the least effort, but it does require familiarity with the Blender engine,
which I don't have yet.

</li>
</ul>
