<h1>What's New</h1>

<hr><table width=100%><tr><td><h3>
Updated for Python 1.5.2
</h3></td><td align=right><address>
June 1, 1999
</address></td></tr></table>

It's been a while, but thanks to an interested user, I've dusted off PUB
and updated it to work with the latest Python (1.5.2).  Have fun, and 
<a href="mailto:joe@strout.net">let me know</a> if you need anything else!


<hr><table width=100%><tr><td><h3>
Save and Restore Implemented
</h3></td><td align=right><address>
August 27, 1996
</address></td></tr></table>

After a little prodding from Andrew, I've finally implemented save and 
restore!  This is a very useful feature which has been sorely needed.  In 
addition to its utility for backups, developers can also use this feature 
to distribute their games without (much) source code.  Just save at the 
starting point, then distribute the <tt>pub.dat</tt> file with a simple 
main program.

<P>
<strong>NOTE</strong>: This update required moving the "player" variable 
from the <tt>pubobjs</tt> module to <tt>pub.py</tt>, where it really belonged all along.  All 
references to <tt>pubobjs.player</tt> should be changed to 
<tt>pub.player</tt>.  In addition, a slight change to the main event loop 
is needed -- see the last few lines of <tt>pubdemo.py</tt>.

<hr><table width=100%><tr><td><h3>
Bug Fixes to Network Module
</h3></td><td align=right><address>
August 5, 1996
</address></td></tr></table>

Thanks mostly to Andrew Kuchling, several bugs have been fixed in
the network support module (<tt>pubtcp.py</tt>) and
its demo (<tt>tcpdemo.py</tt>).

<hr><table width=100%><tr><td><h3>
Network (MUD) Support Added
</h3></td><td align=right><address>
August 1, 1996
</address></td></tr></table>

With the addition of <tt>pubtcp.py</tt>, you can now
use PUB to create a Multi-User Domain (MUD) game!  Now PUB can serve
as the basis for interactive fiction games, MUDs, or both -- using
almost completely the same code. 

<hr><table width=100%><tr><td><h3>
Minor Core Update
</h3></td><td align=right><address>
July 22, 1996
</address></td></tr></table>

The core files have been updated to fix a few minor bugs; also, the
parser now inserts line breaks at the 80th column.  To change this,
use the special command <strong>@break n</strong>, where 
<strong>n</strong> is the number of columns to use, or 0 if you don't
want line breaks.


<hr><table width=100%><tr><td><h3>
Parser Revamped
</h3></td><td align=right><address>
May 11, 1996
</address></td></tr></table>

The PUB parser has been almost completely rewritten.  It now handles
multi-word nouns (e.g., "bucket of fish parts") and verb modifiers
(e.g., "turn on the lamp" or even "turn the lamp on").  And it still
handles conjunction of verbs, something the Other Parsers can't do
(e.g., "turn the lamp on and grin").

<hr><table width=100%><tr><td><h3>
Game Archive Begun
</h3></td><td align=right><address>
May 11, 1996
</address></td></tr></table>

The PUB <a href="Games/index.htm">game archive</a> now has one entry.
It's called "The Greedy Gargoyle", and it's a little 5-minute one-room
text puzzle.  We have to start somewhere...

<hr><table width=100%><tr><td><h3>
PUB documents available as pub.tar.gz
</h3></td><td align=right><address>
May 8, 1996
</address></td></tr></table>

You can now download a copy of the PUB sources and documentation tree
-- in short, a nearly complete copy of this Web site -- as a gzipped 
tar file. <i>This has since been renamed and moved to the PUB
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/py-universe">Source
Forge Project Page</a>, as "Version 0.9beta".</i>

<hr><table width=100%><tr><td><h3>
Gadgets file added
</h3></td><td align=right><address>
</address></td></tr></table>

I've started a file (<tt>gadgets.py</tt>) of gadgets
like cameras, transceivers, buttons, elevators, and so on.  It's still
a bit rough at this point, like all of PUB, but I've uploaded it so
that you all can look at it and offer comments or contribute as much
as you like.  (Besides, several of the gadgets are now used in 
<tt>pubdemo</tt>, so I didn't have much choice!)
