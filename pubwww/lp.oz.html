<H4>Review of the Oz Project at Carnegie Mellon University</H4>
In the 1990's, a group at CMU developed a game engine very much
like what we want to have for "The Light Princess".  It incorporated
relatively simple, but believeable character agents, and a drama
planning mechanism that made for much more "believeable" and
entertaining (if not necessarily more realistic) game play.

<a name="OZ" href="#TOP"><h5>Oz Architecture -- Interactive Fiction Engine</h5></a>
The Oz architecture is illustrated below (after the illustration
in the Hap architecture paper):
<center><img src="oz.arch.gif"></center><br>
The "physical world" is a very simple topological model, almost
exactly like what we find in Interactive Fiction games, so it
seems that the
<a href="lp.pub.html">Python Universe Builder (PUB)</a>
which is based on the same kind of model, should be a good replacement.
This is good, because the world model constituted about 85% of
the code in the Oz Architecture.

<a name="TOK" href="#TOP"><h5>Tok Architecture -- Character Agents</h5></a>
The agent behavior represents most of the functionality of Tok.  Here is a diagram of the
Tok architecture, showing how it relates to the two main components which
comprise it, namely "Em" and "Hap" (from the Tok Architecture paper):

<a name="HAP" href="#TOP"><h5>Hap Architecture -- Goal Seeking</h5></a>
Hap is the side of the Tok architecture that attempts to implement goals
and determine success or failure of plans to achieve its goals.  It is
composed of two primary structures: an "Active Plan Tree" and a
"Plan Memory" and interacts with its environment (represented by
an Interactive Fiction world) and with the companion "Em" module,
which represents emotional and social behavior.  Here is a 
diagram of the Hap architecture, based on the Oz papers:</br>

Details on the architecture can be found in the original paper,
which I highly recommend reading:<br>

<a name="EM" href="#TOP"><h5>Em Architecture -- Emotions</h5></a>
Em is the emotional subsystem of Tok.  I'm less sure of the maturity
of this system, and, given the need to re-implement the code,
I'm considering using my original emotive behavior architecture
instead (documented in the existing CVS for <b>The Light Princess</b>),
but Em should be adequate for our game, so it's possible
that we should simply implement it as it was.  This may be simpler
in the end.
<p>
To give an idea of the level of complexity in Em, here's a list of
the emotions understood by the version of Em used to implement the
"Lyotard" game (in which the agent modeled a cat):<br>

<a name="SUMMARY" href="#TOP"><h5>Summary</h5></a>
The Oz architecture seems to be an excellent fit to our needs.
It demonstrates the feasibility of this approach, and has adequate
documentation to completely re-implement the architecture in
Python, which should be well-adapted to representing the structures
and algorithms used.  Tok originally consumed about 7500 lines
of code (mostly in Lisp), and I think our implementation will
probably be no larger.
<p>
The world model for Oz was implemented in Lisp, and is described
in a way that sounds almost exactly like the model found in
interactive fiction games made with Inform or TADS.  Since the
<a href="lp.pub.html">Python Universe Builder (PUB)</a>
was also built to follow this model, it should be an excellent
fit.  Thus we should be able to implement almost the entire
engine in Python.
</p>
<p>
The Oz Project produced a lot of papers and online information
as well.  I have selected a few key papers to illustrate the
architecture as concisely as possible.  However, a visit to
the original
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/oz/web/oz.html">Oz Project Website</a>
will be well worth the trouble, if you are interested in
this project.  There are many more papers available from
there (and also the uncompressed forms of the papers above,
in case you have trouble uncompressing these).
</p>

<h4>XML File Formats</h4>
Another change we need to apply is using an XML-based
unified language for describing characters.  The Oz Project
apparently used a custom language grammar for this.  We
want ours to be XML compliant and be embedable with the
rest of the game design files.
<p>
The DTD for this block (<b>character</b>) must encompass at least:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Emotion</b> (for <em>Em</em> analog).
  <ul>
  <li><b>attitudes</b> (towards other characters and objects)</li>
  <li><b>standards</b> (conduct standards applied to self and others</li>
  <li><b>...?</b> (review Em architecture further)</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
 <b>Planning</b> (for <em>Hap</em>) analog).
  <ul>
  <li><b>plan library</b> (contains all possible plans?)</li>
  <li><b>actions</b> (primitive actions)</li>
  <li><b>lines</b> or <b>expressions</b> (for output to PUB/AutoManga layers)</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
<b>Resources</b> (for <em>AutoManga</em> output layers).
   <ul>
   <li><b>Walk Cels</b> (for sprite walk cycle, etc.)</li>
   <li><b>Expression Cels</b> (for close-ups / reaction shots)</li>
   <li><b>Cutaways</b> (various scripted inserts, selected to show actions).
   </ul>
</li>
</ul>
