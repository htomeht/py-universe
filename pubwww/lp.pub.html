<a href="#TOP" name="HISTORY"><H4>History of PUB</H4></a>
I discovered PUB quite recently, but it was actually written in
about 1996 by Joseph J. Strout.  I was very excited when I found
out about it, because it was exactly what I needed for AutoManga --
an engine and language environment which would work like developing
games in Inform for the Z-Machine, but run under Python, with full
access to the computer's resources.  This makes it possible to
interface with the software easily for use with the
<a href="lp.automanga.html#PRESENTER">AutoManga Presenter</a>,
and also to extend it with the capabilities
like those in the
<a href="lp.oz.html#TOK">Tok Architecture</a>.
<p>
Beyond this, I'm still evaluating PUB, but it seems to have a
number of nice features beyond what you usually get in an
interactive fiction system, for example: partial real-time
capabilities and multi-user play (support for MUDs) via
TCP/IP connections.  Also, since the player character is
modeled like a non-player character, and because the system
is object-oriented, there is direct support for characters
to pass messages to each other and to other objects in
the environment, thus supporting the basic hooks needed
for Tok architecture emotional agents to be used.
</p>

<a href="#TOP" name="STATUS"><h4>Status of PUB</h4></a>
PUB has been sitting unattended for awhile now.  The author
has moved on, and so although it appears to be functional,
it needs to be maintained.  Also, there's almost no documentation,
although there are extensive comments in the source code.
<p>
This being the case, I volunteered to adopt the code and
put up a Source Forge site for it.  As soon as the present
problems with Source Forge are resolved, I plan to do this.
I spoke to Mr. Strout about this and we are in agreement.
He'll adjust his site to reflect the change as soon as the
new Source Forge site is up and running (which hopefully
won't be too long).
</p>
<p>
My development plan for PUB is:
<ol>
<li>Test with sample game provided</li>
<li>Fix any Python upgrade problems</li>
<li>Set up Source Forge site</li>
<li>Add doc strings to all classes and methods based on comments</li>
<li>Create automatic documentation using the doc strings</li>
<li>Review code and write architectural design documentation</li>
<li>Adapt the one-room "Alice" tutorial (from Inform) to PUB</li>
<li>Normalize this as PUB version 1.0.x</li>
<li>Package the resulting version for distribution</li>
<li>Begin extending to version 1.1.x (development)</li>
</ol>
This will provide a clean breakpoint for anyone who
wants to do other things with PUB, and we can then
extend it as needed to support character agents and
the AutoManga Presenter.
</p>
<h3>Enhancements for PUB</h3>
In order to provide hooks for AutoManga, and as general
adaptations of the system, I want to add:
<ul>
<li>
Tkinter menu-based input.  This follows an interface concept we
discussed for The Light Princess.  The idea is that game play
could be smoother if there were less confusion about what verbs
will be understood by the parser (since it's not realistic to
have a parser that understands full English).  This has been
criticized as the "slippery slope" towards the "Myst" model,
where there's only mouse-controlled input, and essentially
only one verb "click-on-object", which causes all game play
to be driven by defaults.  However, I think there's a broad
middle ground here:  I want to stay fairly close to the IF
side, but with less frustration learning the parsers' vocabulary.
(Later I hope this will be ported to an SDL-based GUI
such as 
<a href="lp.automanga.html#PARAGUI">ParaGUI</a>).
</li>

<li>
XML File format.  This will involve defining a DTD for
the important design elements (such as rooms and characters).
It is assumed that more complex extensions will involve
programming directly in Python, but this will be used to automate
time-consuming programming task, such as laying out rooms.
</li>

<li>
In-Scene modeling.  Limited 3D positioning within a room, to
support the AutoManga scene model -- camera choices, sound
mixing, etc.  This information will be available to 
characters that are within the room and to the presentation
engine (but will be lost when one moves to a new room).
</li>

<li>
Integration with Oz character models.  This seems like a
trivial extension of the "Actor" object within PUB.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
And of course, the room design format will be integrated with the
design system I worked out with
<a href="lp.automanga.html#XCIRCUIT">XCircuit</a>
as a room/level layout tool.
</p>
