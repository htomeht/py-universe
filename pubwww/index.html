<h1>Introduction</h1>

The <strong>Python Universe Builder</strong> (aka <strong>PUB</strong>) is
a set of <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> modules for writing
text-based adventure games or
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Recreation/Games/Interactive_Fiction/">interactive fiction</a>.

<hr>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Sophisticated sentence parser (in some ways, better than Infocom's).
	<li>Fully object-oriented.
	<li>Rich, deep language which is remarkably easy to learn and use.
	<li>Includes full source code for the system.
	<li>May be connected to other services (web, TCP/IP, scripting languages, etc.).
	<li>May be extended in C, C++, FORTRAN, etc.
	<li>Runs on almost any platform.
	<li>May be used as a <strong>multi-player network game</strong> (i.e., a MUD).
	<li><strong>Free software</strong> (LGPL License).
</ul>
Many of these features are simply the features of <a
href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> itself, which is one of the best
languages I've ever seen (and definitely the best interpreted language
I've ever seen).  In addition, the PUB modules offer some innovative
features not found in other interactive-fiction builders:
<ul>
	<li>an event-based scheduler which handles timing in a powerful way
	<li>output is directed not just at the player, but at any object which is 
		listening
	<li>all actors (both the player and NPCs) have equal status and abilities
		(though these may, of course, be modified by the game designer)
</ul>

<a name="HISTORY"></a>
<H3>History of PUB</H3></a>
<p>
I (Terry Hancock) first discovered PUB in 2000, but it was 
actually written in about 1996 by Joseph J. Strout.  I was very
excited when I found out about it, because it was exactly what I
needed at the time -- an engine and language environment which
would work like developing games in Inform for the Z-Machine, but
run under Python, with full access to the computer's resources.
This makes it possible to interface with the software easily for
building extended environments or interfaces.
</p>
<p>
At the time I was working on an adventure game project 
<a href="http://light-princess.sourceforge.net">The Light Princess</a>,
and PUB looked like a good base to start the game engine, since
we really wanted a graphic engine that "felt" more like using
the old text adventure (or "interactive fiction") games. I thought
of it as "interactive cinema".
</p>
<p>
However, that is a <i>really</i> ambitious idea, and as the primary
interest in <b>The Light Princess</b> was from artists and writers,
rather than programmers, and as I was not up to writing the engine myself,
and as, late in 2000, I got a "real" job, the project just stalled.
</p>
<p>
The Py-Universe/PUB project sat here for about 24 months, with very
little being done to it, although it was during this time that I added
some of the docstrings, and Lalo Martins added the necessary machinery
for PUB to install as a proper Python package.
</p>
<p>
In 2003, interest perked up, particularly driven by
<a href="mailto:gbay@users.sourceforge.net">Gabriel Jägenstedt</a>,
who has been the most active developer over the last few months, and is
still quite active (2004-2).
</p>
<p>
PUB has a
number of nice features beyond what you usually get in an
interactive fiction system, for example: partial real-time
capabilities and multi-user play (support for MUDs) via
TCP/IP connections.  Also, since the player character is
modeled like a non-player character, and because the system
is object-oriented, there is direct support for characters
to pass messages to each other and to other objects in
the environment.
</p>
<p>
For the <b>The Light Princess</b> project, I had visualized
building on the <a href="oz.html">Oz Architecture</a> to
create more interesting characters.  This still seems like
a good idea, but it is definitely non-trivial in complexity.
However, most of the code in the original Oz project (unfortunately
not available -- I made some inquiries, and it seems to be
essentially lost), was simply to provide the "topological world-model"
(which is what PUB does already).  Thus it seems like a natural
to extend the PUB character object into an Oz-like agent.
</p>
<p>
Maybe someday, when I've got more time, and/or no one else has already
done this, I'll give it a whirl.  Meanwhile, I hope the references
are interesting.
</p>
<p>
The other extension I had considered, was graphic presentation. At the
time, not much existed to support this, so I started the
<a href="http://automanga.sourceforge.net">Automanga Project</a> to build
one. I'm not sure how relevant this project is now, and I have not worked
on it for a long time (there is some C code to do cel animation with SDL
and to handle procedural lighting effects, but that's about it).  The
existence of the Java <a href="http://www.animatronik.org">Animatronik</a>
seemed to obviate the need for some of the animation and "expressions"
work in Automanga, but alas, that project looks dead, too (2004-2).
</p>
<p>
A much more exciting possibility is to use the 
<a href="http://www.blender.org">Blender</a> Game Engine,
which is NOW FREE, thanks to the historic 2003 community purchase deal. Since
it already embeds a Python interpreter, the possibility for integration
seems great.  On the downside, I'm still just barely learning to use
the Blender application, let alone experiment with the game engine.  Blender
even does the "cartoon rendering" that we had discussed during the Light Princess
project, and I believe it is possible to use 2-D animation elements within a
3-D Blender world.  It's certainly worth investigating if you have an
interest in it.  Again, someday I plan to check this out, but it may be
a long time in coming.

<h3>How should I start?</h3>

First, look at some <a href="Games/index.htm">games</a> written with PUB.  Depending on your system, you may need to first get and install Python (which is free), or you may be able to get stand-alone executables.
<P>
Next, read the <a href="Doc/index.htm">documentation</a>, which includes
<a href="Doc/tutorial/index.htm">a simple tutorial</a>.  This will lead
you through the process of creating a very simple interactive-fiction
game from scratch.
<P>
Then browse the <a href="Doc/lib/index.htm">library reference</a>.  This shows you all the great object classes that have already been defined, so all you have to do is drop them in your game and give them names and descriptions.
<P>
Finally, go back to the <a href="Games/index.htm">games</a> you've played a bit, and examine their code.  Now that you've gotten the general idea, you should be able to understand what makes these games do what they do, and you're ready to start designing your own.
