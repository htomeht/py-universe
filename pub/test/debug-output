                            THE GREEDY GARGOYLE
                           A 5-Minute Text Puzzle
                               by Joe Strout

Holding your latern high, you cautiously explore the stone panel before you. 
According to the maps, the entrance to the tomb should be right at the end of
this passageway -- but you find only smooth stone.

Just as you're about to give up and go home, your fingers catch on a small
indentation on the adjoining wall.  When you press the knob inside, the panel
spins around, carrying you with it.

You find yourself in a small room.  The panel through which you entered joins
perfectly with the wall on this side, leaving no hope of returning the way you
came.  You'd been studying for years to find a way into the tomb -- now, if you
can just find a way out...

Fountain Room
You're in a small room with walls of stone.  In the middle of the room is a
raised stone pool filled with water.  To the north is a great stone door, into
which a gargoyle has been carved with amazingly lifelike detail.
