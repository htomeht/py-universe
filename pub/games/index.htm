If you write a PUB game, please be sure to <a href="mailto:joe@strout.net">send me</a>
a copy.  I'm still developing the core routines, and if I have a copy of your game,
I'll update them when necessary.  I'll also post your game here for distribution,
if you wish.

<strong>The Greedy Gargoyle</strong> is a 5-Minute Text Puzzle.  It consists
of a single source file (<a href="gredgar.py">gredgar.py</a>), which requires
the standard PUB library to run.  (No fair peeking at the source before you've
solved the puzzle!)
