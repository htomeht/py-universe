If you write a PUB game, please be sure to <a
href="mailto:py-universe-main@lists.sourceforge.net">send us</a> a
note about it.  We're still developing the core routines, and if we
have a copy of your game, we may update them when necessary.  We'll
also post your game here for distribution, if you wish.

<strong>The Greedy Gargoyle</strong> is a 5-Minute Text Puzzle.  It consists
of a single source file (<a href="gredgar.py">gredgar.py</a>), which requires
the standard PUB library to run.  (No fair peeking at the source before you've
solved the puzzle!)
