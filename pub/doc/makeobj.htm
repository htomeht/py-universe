Creating Objects from Existing Classes
</h1>
</center>

This is pretty easy.  The general form is:<pre>
objid = Classname("main name,synonym1,synonym2")
objid.property = value
objid.property2 = value

</pre>Broken down into parts, we have
<ol>
<li><strong>objid</strong> - some identifier, unique within the file.  This can
be any valid Python variable name, but the standard form is to begin with a
lowercase letter.  Examples: rock, coat, greenSlime, furryHairBall.
<li><strong>Classname</strong> - the name of a previously defined object class.
Unless it's defined in the same file, you'll have to prefix it with the name
of the file where it is defined.  Examples: pubobjs.Thing, pubobjs.NPC, 
gadgets.Elevator, MySpecialWidget.
<li><strong>name and synonyms</strong> - in the parenthesis, put a string 
containing the object's main name and any number of synonyms, separated by
commas.  Example: "rock,stone,large pebble,large,small boulder,small".  Note
that whenever you have a multiword name or synonym, the first word of the name
must also be given by itself.
<li><strong>property</strong> - this is the name of a valid property for the
object class.  This may be found by directly examining the source code (they're
commented), or (eventually) in the <a href="lib/index.htm">library reference</a>.
Examples: light, size, isOpen.
<li><strong>value</strong> - you can assign any Python value to any property,
but their meaning varies.  A property like "light" generally expects a number
between 0 and 100; boolean values like "isOpen" expect TRUE or FALSE, and string
properties like "desc" expect a string in quotes.
</ol>

<h3>Examples</h3><pre>
# create a room
northend = Room("North End of Town")
northend.desc = "Standing at the north end of the town, you have shops on \
three sides and the center of town to the south."

# create some objects (they go into the most recently created room)
barrel = pubobjs.Container("barrel,keg")
barrel.desc = "A large wooden barrel has been set at the end of the street."
barrel.canContainLiquid = TRUE
barrel.size = 30

water = pubobjs.Liquid("water,H2O")
water.size = 5
water.MoveTo(barrel)       # place the water inside the barrel 
</pre>
