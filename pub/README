This is a "Alpha2" release of the PUB aka PyUniverse package.  
It *is* now a package thanks to Lalo Martins. <applause/>


Quick starter notes:

Dependencies:
 python2.3
 distutils -- distutils is released as a seperate package, for most
 distributions it should be named along the line of python-devXX where XX is the
 python version.

1) You can install the package with distutils like so:

from the pub directory:
 python setup.py install

It's pure python, so don't worry about building extensions -- there
aren't any.

2) To see what it does, run the Greedy Gargoyle example:

cd pub/games/
python gredgar.py

This is a simple, one-room interactive-fiction adventure.

There is documentation generated from HappyDoc in pub/doc, which
is certainly more useful than it was, but is a long way from being
complete.


Other notes:

The official website is on Sourceforge: http://py-universe.sourceforge.net
(unfortunately, "pub" is a reserved word!).

There's a mailing list (very low volume): py-universe-main@lists.sourceforge.net

There is a wiki currently located at:
 http://www.narya.net/PyUniverse_SF_Net/PyUniverse/FrontPage

We also have a irc channel on irc.freenode.net:: #py-universe

The current maintainer is: Terry Hancock hancock@anansispaceworks.com

The rest of the team should be reachable through the mailing-list which is
almost always the best way to go unless you have a specific maintainer 
question.
