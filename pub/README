2002-11/21:
This is a tentative "Alpha" release of the PUB aka PyUniverse
package.  It *is* now a package thanks to Lalo Martins. <applause/>

It only recently occured to me that I really ought to make a
downloadable package of this work.  I have been meaning to
write more documentation and/or experiment with the package,
but I have been really busy on other projects, so no dice.

However ...

Extremely quick starter notes:

1) You can install the package with distutils like so:

python setup.py install

It's pure python, so don't worry about building extensions -- there
aren't any.

2) To see what it does, run the Greedy Gargoyle example:

cd pub/games/
python gredgar.py

This is a simple, one-room interactive-fiction adventure.

There is documentation generated from HappyDoc in pub/doc, which
is certainly more useful than it was, but is a long way from being
complete.


Other notes:

The official website is on Sourceforge: http://py-universe.sourceforge.net
(unfortunately, "pub" is a reserved word!).

There's a mailing list (very low volume): py-universe-main@lists.sourceforge.net

The current maintainer is me: Terry Hancock hancock@anansispaceworks.com
