This is organized as a plugin directory. Each module extends
the range of "noun aspects" or "specific nouns" understood by
the PUB language engine.  See specific modules for detailed
descriptions, but in brief:

NOUN ASPECTS

These are "mix-ins" or "components" which provide basic engine
functionality for specific kinds of operations understood by the
engine.  They are in a way, the primitives for building noun objects.

topology -- structural properties of nouns (containment, positional
            prepositions, connectivity, etc).  This determines whether
	    noun objects can be placed inside of, in front of, etc
	    other noun objects.

state    -- support for "state engine" nouns, such as lights, switches,
            machines, and simple characters (walk-on type).

matter   -- basic properties of matter: size, weight, state of matter, etc.

tool     -- nouns which interact with verbs to act on other nouns (generally
            provide indirect object support and are used transitively).

food     -- nouns which affect agents through eating or drinking, including
            food, drink, medicine, and poison.

vehicle  -- nouns which have regularly-structure topological changes controlled
            by state (deps on topology & state): elevators, cars, trains, etc.

animal   -- state engines with common animal traits (gets hungry, eats,
            drinks, plays, etc).

SPECIFIC NOUNS

Specific noun objects common enough that you wouldn't want to have to
redefine all of them for a game.

foods    -- a collection of basic food objects (wine, bread, cheese, etc)

vehicles -- a collection of basic vehicles (car, train, bicycle, elevator)

animals  -- cats, dogs, farm animals, etc
