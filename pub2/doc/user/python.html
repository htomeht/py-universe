THIS PAGE NOT UPDATED FOR PUB 2.x
(it's way out of date, so take
what you see with a grain of salt.
However, this is what we have to
start with).

Python hasn't changed that much, but
this page is based on v1.5.2, and we're
on v2.4!  I think we might want to just
refer to a more comprehensive source,
as there are lots of books and how-tos
for Python now.

<a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> is a full language, used to build web servers, browsers, databases, utilities, and yes, even games.  There is a wealth of documentation and examples available on the web.  This page doesn't even scratch the surface -- but perhaps it will be enough to get you started, or serve as a quick reference for commonly needed syntax.  For more detail, consult <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/">the Python documentation</a>.

<h4>Datatypes</h4><pre>
42                              # an integer
42.0                            # a real number
'wow' or "wow"                  # a string
[1,5,7,9]                       # a list
mylist[0]                       # the first element of list mylist
{1:'one',42:'life'}             # a dictionary (maps 1 to 'one', etc.)

<p><h4>Assignments</h4><pre>
this = that                     # assign this the value of that
ultimateAnswer = 42             # store 42 in variable ultimateAnswer
kitten = Kitten("Fluffy")       # create a new Kitten, and store it in kitten
name = kitten.GetName()         # store kitten's current name in name
a,b,c = 1,2,3                   # multiple assignments at once
</pre>

<p><h4>Function Calls</h4><pre>
isString('wow')                 # evaluates to 1 if 'wow' is a string (it is)
myObject.DoSomething()          # call myObject's DoSomething() method
</pre>
<strong>Note</strong>: Class functions (methods) are defined with the first parameter specified, e.g. def GetName(self), but called with the object name <strong>before</strong> the method name, e.g. self.GetName() .
