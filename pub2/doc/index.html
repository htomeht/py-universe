<h3>Welcome to Interactive Fiction with</h3>
<h1>Python Universe Builder</h1>

<font color="red">
<p>
This is not really a release -- it is really only for discussion value.  At this time (2006-2/13)
PUB2 does not import or run, so don't get your hopes up. We are reorganizing the code significantly
from the original design concept. This is largely to modernize coding techniques, and
provide greater flexibility.

<h3>Documentation for Game Developers (Users)</h3>
<p>
Here is the original documentation for PUB 1.  Some of it remains useful as a guide to
the older parts of the code and/or to what we should be trying to recover. Most of it is
badly out of date and will need to be updated.

<h3>About the Name</h3>
<p>
We're accustomed to calling Python Universe Builder "PUB", as in a place you
go to drink beer. Pubs have played an important part in interactive fiction
games (if for no other reason than Douglas Adams' "Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Galaxy" which was one of the better Infocom(TM) IF games). It's also what
Joe Strout called his original package.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, "pub" is also frequently used to refer to a public download
area, so it is often a reserved word (as on Sourceforge).
So, PUB is also known as "py-universe", which the SF project name.  It's
still "PUB", though.
