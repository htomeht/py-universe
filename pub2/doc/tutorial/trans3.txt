Downstairs Room
You're on the ground floor of a tiny house.  The walls are featureless, 
and you can find no doors or windows.  However, there is a ladder that 
leads up through a little hole in the ceiling.

  You see a potted plant lying here.


>up
You head up.

Upstairs Room

ladder leads down.
