<h1>Agents for PUB</h1>
The basic distribution of Python Universe Builder contains only very simple "state machine"
representations of non-player characters. However, PUB's object design makes it relatively
easy to hook agent-based code into PUB -- all characters, including the player, are just
objects in the PUB world model.
<p>
We call those objects "agents" if they can initiate turns on their own initiative by passing
messages to other objects.  Turn-based agents can register to be called on each turn, allowing
them to take a turn every time the player does. Real-time agents can be called on a clock-tick
to update their own state.  Either way, agents can do just about anything the player can.
</p>

<h1>Emerald</h1>
Based on this capability, Terry Hancock is starting a package called
<a href="http://py-universe.sf.net/Emerald">Emerald</a> to provide
character agents for PUB, inspired by the "Oz Project" approach, and
motivated primarily by the desire to create rich characters for 
<a href="http://light-princess.sf.net">The Light Princess</a> game.
<p>
As of this writing (2006), though, it's still a long way from happening.
</p>
<p>
Emerald will be an add-on package for PUB, and you should visit the
Emerald site for more information on it's progress.
