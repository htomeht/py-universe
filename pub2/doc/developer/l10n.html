<h1>Localizing the PUB IF Engine</h1>
[TBD: this is meant to be sort of a how-to as well as a reference]

Outlined elements:
<a name="GRAMMAR"><h3>Grammar Locale File: <i>locale</i><b>.py</b></h3></a>
Although much of the grammar processing is general purpose, and is provided
for by the <tt>utility/l14n.py</tt> module, it is necessary to write a little
bit of Python code to specify how language in a given locale should be parsed
and generated. Some of the key knowledge that must be included:

<ul>
<li>What is the prefered order of words in a clause (i.e. a simple sentence)?</li>
<li>How do you correctly conjugate a verb, including: the class of the verb, the
person, tense, and aspect needed?</li>
<li>How do you correctly decline a noun or noun phrase?</li>
<li>How do you pluralize a noun?</li>
<li>How do you ensure that adjectives, adverbs, articles, and other words in the
sentence 'agree' with each other syntactically? (e.g. with matching gender and number,
as in Romance languages)</li>
<li>How do you make a sentence <i>negative</i>? (This varies wildly between languages!).</li>
</ul>
<p>
In my opinion, general linguistics and programming skill is more important than a working
fluency in the language to write the grammar file, so it might not always be written by
the same people who localize the messages and vocabulary (I would say that the average 2nd
year language student in a language probably knows enough grammar to do this well). You
are essentially creating a formal framework for the other two files to operate in.  If
your language is grammatically very similar to a provided locale, you would be well
advised to start by copying that file's localization grammar module and modifying it
to suit your language (for example all Romance languages have very similar grammar, so
a Romanian localization probably ought to start with Spanish or French locale grammar modules).
</p>

<a name="MESSAGES"><h3>Messages Locale File: <i>locale</i><b>.po</b></h3></a>
This is the "boring part" or the "easy part" depending on your perspective! For ordinary
messages from the engine, we simply use the gettext facility. If you've ever done
localization work for any other program, you'll find this part familiar.
<p>
For people new to this work, let me direct you to some well-written tutorials on
using gettext. [links? or we might have to include a brief tutorial here?]
</p>

<a name="VOCABULARY"><h3>Vocabulary Locale File: <i>locale</i><b>.xml</b></h3></a>
The vocabulary file, as you might expect, defines a bunch of words. More accurately,
it <i>glosses</i> the IF engine's "semantic concepts" to words in the host language.
It also provides the information need to properly use those words in sentences (including
inflection such as: tense, conjugation, declension, pluralization, and definiteness).
<p>
Even "purely analytic" languages like Chinese need to define special words for marking
noun and verb phrases to indicate such usage distinctions.  Most languages use some
combination of "word structure" (synthesis) and "phrase structure" (analysis). The vocabulary
file provides a bit of support for both.
</p>
<p>
Game vocabulary files will be very similar to the engine localization vocabulary, but
probably somewhat simpler, since it's unlikely that a game will need to provide for
conjunctions, punctuation, articles, declension, or prepositions. More likely, most
games will only need to provide nouns and verbs, with some adding adjectives and adverbs.
</p>
<p>
If you are writing the engine vocabulary file, however, you should take seriously the
fact that game localizers are going to be following your lead. I recommend putting in
comments in the locale language to help localizers (who may be less fluent than you are
in English) figure out what they need to put in the file and where to put it.

I'm working on a formal spec for this XML format, but here's an example to give you the idea.
Pardon the badness of my Spanish, but the English example overlooks too many useful features:
<textarea cols=100 rows=20>
<locale language="es">
<verbs>
    <verb lbl="go">
        <g  inf="ir"        imp="ven"       prp="va"        pri="esta vayando"  />
        <g  inf="mover"     imp="mueve"     prp="mueve"     pri="esta moviendo" />
        <g  reg="camin~"    cl="AR"/>
    </verb>

    <verb lbl="enter">
        <g  reg="entr~" cl="AR" />
    </verb>

    <verb lbl="put">
        <g  inf="poner"     imp="ponga"     prp="pone"      pri="esta poniendo" />
    </verb>

    <verb lbl="get">
        <g  inf="obtenir"   imp="obtenga"   prp="obtiene"   pri="esta obteniendo" />
    </verb>

<!-- etc. ... -->

</verbs>

<nouns>
    <noun lbl="book">   <g  reg="libro"  cl="M"/>    </noun>
    <noun lbl="pen">    <g  reg="pluma"  cl="F"/>    </noun>
<!-- etc. ... -->
</noun>

<adjectives>
    <adjective lbl="red"    ><g reg="roj~o"/>    </adjective>
    <adjective lbl="blue"   ><g reg="azul"/>     </adjective>
<!-- etc. ... -->
</adjective>
</locale>
</textarea>
</p>
<p>
Some tag/element explanations:
<dl>

<dt><b>locale</b></dt>
<dd>
This element is the wrapper for the whole file and identifies the locale information.
</dd>

<dt><b>verbs, nouns, adverbs, adjectives, declension, prepositions, articles</b></dt>
<dd>
These are the group elements for the parts of speech. Note that they are all spelled out
and pluralized.  It's probably a good idea to include a comment in these blocks with the
native term for the part of speech being defined. Remember that the engine locale files
will be used as models by people writing locales for games, and they may be less fluent
in English, especially on picky matters of grammatical terms.  If you can provide help
for them in your native language, this is probably a good thing.
</dd>

<dt><b>verb, noun, advb, adje, decl, prep, artl</b></dt>
<dd>
These elements are used once for each symbolic object recognized internally by PUB's
"semantic" concept language.  The labels ("lbl" attribute) will generally be English
words because that's the language we use in core development (but strictly speaking
this isn't required). It will often be desireable to include a comment showing a usage
example or exact meaning within PUB, in order to make fine distinctions in glossing words.
</dd>

<dt><b>conjunctions, punctuation</b></dt>
<dd>
These special sections define the conjunction and punctuation tokens which are
used to delimit clauses within a sentence. PUB doesn't assign any particular meaning
to these words, it just uses them to break up multi-clause sentences into single
clause "simple sentences" (commands) to be dispatched in order.
</dd>

<dt><b>g</b></dt>
<dd>
The "g" or "gloss" element is the most basic and has complex attributes to allow
for a range of language behaviors:<br/>
<i>Basic Gloss Attributes (for regular grammar elements)</i>
  <dl>
    <dt><b>reg</b></dt>
    <dd>
    The most basic element is the "reg" or "regular" attribute. If provided, this
    indicates that the word follows standard behaviors which the Python locale grammar
    module can be expected to figure out procedurally. Three important cases:
        <ul>
        <li>Regularly conjugating verbs.</li>
        <li>Regularly declined nouns.</li>
        <li>Nouns, verbs, etc, that do not change (as in English or Chinese).</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    
    <dt><b>cl</b></dt>
    <dd>
    Closely linked to the "reg" attribute is the "cl" or "class" attribute. This
    can be used to identify major classes of verbs (as in Spanish "AR", "ER", and
    "IR" verbs) or classes of nouns (as in Spanish "M" or "F" gender nouns, or
    Swahili "M/WA", "KI/VI" class nouns, etc).<br/><br/>
    Note that the python locale grammar module for your language may provide shortcuts
    to avoid having to use the "cl" tag explicitly. The example above assumes that
    the module provides such special handling for adjectives.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  
<i>Attributes for irregular verbs</i>
  <dl>
    <dt><b>inf</b></dt>
    <dd>
    The "inf" attribue overrides the representation of the verb in the "infinitive" 
    conjugation (the dictionary form).  This is used for identification only, since
    PUB never actually needs to use the infinitive.
    </dd>

    <dt><b>imp</b></dt>
    <dd>
    The "imp" attribute overrides the representation of the "imperative" conjugation
    and tense of the verb.
    </dd>

    <dt><b>prp</b></dt>
    <dd>
    The "prp" attribute overrides the "present perfective" tense of the verb. This
    means the tense that is used to report what actions you have completed. (e.g.
    "you <b>get</b> the hammer"). [We're probably going to need variants like 'prp2'
    and 'prp3' to deal with cases of 2nd &amp; 3rd person conjugation differences)].
    </dd>

    <dt><b>pri</b></dt>
    <dd>
    The "pri" attribute overrides the "present imperfective" tense of the verb. This
    means the tense that is used to describe an ongoing state-like condition, such
    as "you <b>are standing</b> on the table".
    </dd>
  </dl>
  
<i>Attributes for irregular nouns</i>
  <dl>
    <dt><b>nom</b></dt> <dd>Nominative declension for noun.</dd>
    <dt><b>acc</b></dt> <dd>Accusative declension for noun.</dd>
    <dt><b>dat</b></dt> <dd>Dative declension for noun.</dd>
    <dt><b>gen</b></dt> <dd>Genitive declension for noun.</dd>
    <dt><b>ins</b></dt> <dd>Instrumental declension for noun.</dd>
    <dt><b>prp</b></dt> <dd>Prepositional declension for noun.</dd>
  </dl>
</dd>
</dl>
