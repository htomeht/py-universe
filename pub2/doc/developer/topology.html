<h1>Topological Models</h1>
Topological models are Noun Interfaces, and associated Noun component classes. They provide
a basic framework for conceptually representing the "physical space" within the game.

<h3>Simple Container</h3>
<p>
Simple containers have the simplest topology, and have been included in PUB from the
beginning.  A simple container object can contain other objects.  It is therefore
exactly like a directory or folder object in a filesystem, with other objects acting
like ordinary files or sub-directories.
</p>
<p>
You can get a lot of mileage out of simple containers, by depending on the player's
tendency to conceptualize the game by context. For example, a table and a box may
both be represented by simple containers.  The player tends to correctly say "put
item <i>on</i> table" and "put item <i>in</i> box", even if the IF engine actually
doesn't care whether you say "in" or "on".  This might be regarded as an example
of the "Eliza Phenomenon" where the player ascribes more sophistication to the 
engine than it really has, via the use of their own imagination.
</p>
<p>
Still, the illusion is strained when the player says "put anvil on box" and the
IF engine responds "you put the anvil in the box", and there are obviously lost
opportunities for more sophisticated game puzzles.
</p>

<h3>Brick Model</h3>
<p>
The next level of complexity might be described as the "brick model". Most natural
languages have fairly straightforward ways of expressing the twelve spatial
relationships in the brick model, and it is a pretty common way to conceptualize
spatial relationships, as illustrated below:

</map>

<h5>Attached Locations</h5>
<p>These six relative locations refer to nouns being attached to the noun, and
can be thought of as special categories of containment (i.e. it could be modeled
by an object with six containment groups identified by prepositions). You'll note
that in English at least, these mostly require "multi-word prepositions". It violates
the grammatical pedagogy of English, of course, but the easiest way to handle this
is to treat these as "compound word prepositions" and catch them right
after the lexing process.  They also have more than one common formulation, so
it's necessary to have synonyms:

<dl>
<dt><a name="ON_TOP"><b>on top of, on, on the top of</b></dt>
<dd>Location is attached (possibly by gravity) to the top surface of the object.</dd>

<dt><a name="ON_BOTTOM"><b>on bottom of, on the bottom of</b></dt>
<dd>Location is attached to the bottom surface of the object.</dd>

<dt><a name="ON_FRONT"><b>on front of, on the front of, on the front side of</b></dt>
<dd>Location is attached to the front surface of the object.</dd>

<dt><a name="ON_BACK"><b>on back of, on the back of, on the back side of</b></dt>
<dd>Location is attached to the back surface of the object.</dd>

<dt><a name="ON_LEFT"><b>on left of, on the left of, on the left side of</b></dt>
<dd>Location is attached to the left surface of the object.</dd>

<dt><a name="ON_RIGHT"><b>on right of, on the right of, on the right side of</b></dt>
<dd>Location is attached to the right surface of the object</dd>
</dl>

<p>
For all of these locations, if the object is moved, the location moves with it, as will
anything that was put there.  Clearly this requires the objects to be "attachable" to
each other, which might be another thing to model.
</p>

<h5>Adjacent Locations</h5>
<p>
The other six locations are merely adjacent to the object -- they do not express
any containment by the object at all, but rather the spatial location relative to the object
in the parent container (which will often be the room).  You can think of this as a
variant of a Z-sort representation, except that X- and Y- sorts are also done. These
locations determine where the objects will be when the sort is resolved. This would
be quite an easy concept to translate back and forth from a 3D graphical game
environment, and so this kind of topology might be useful for applications where
the PUB engine is being used to provide game logic for a graphical environment (as
when it is used as part of <a href="http://light-princess.sf.net/Universe">Universe</a>).
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="TO_LEFT"><b>to left of, to the left of</b></dt><dd><i>X &lt; X<sub>0</sub></i></dd>
<dt><a name="TO_RIGHT"><b>to right of, to the right of</b></dt><dd><i>X &gt; X<sub>0</sub></i></dd>
<dt><a name="OVER"><b>over, above</b></dt><dd><i>Y &gt; Y<sub>0</sub></i></dd>
<dt><a name="UNDER"><b>under, beneath</b></dt><dd><i>Y &lt; Y<sub>0</sub></i></dd>
<dt><a name="TO_FRONT"><b>in front of</b></dt><dd><i>Z &gt; Z<sub>0</sub></i></dd>
<dt><a name="BEHIND"><b>behind, in back of</b></dt><dd><i>Z &lt; Y<sub>0</sub></i></dd>
</dl>

<p>
The brick model has limitations, of course. One of them is that it assumes the
relationship between the player and the object (if you're not facing the "front"
of the object, then everything changes). Another is that many objects are not
remotely cube shaped, so that they may have more complex "locations" conceptually,
and also so that some logical inferences you might be tempted to draw from the
brick model wouldn't work (it's possible to be simultaneously "above" and "below"
an object shaped like a "C", for example).
</p>

<h3>Relative versus Absolute Brick Model</h3>
<p>
First of all, the brick model above is subjective (it depends on how the character is
facing the object).  So the first refinement we might add is to create an analogous
"absolute" system, by replacing "left", "right", "front", and "back" with
"east", "west", "south", and "north".  "Over" and "under" (or "top" and "bottom"),
would remain the same, being determined by gravity (extending this for free-fall
use is an exercise left to the reader <tt>;-)</tt>).
</p>
<p>
It should be possible even, to represent locations in an absolute form internally,
then dereference them based on the player's location relative to the object. On the
other hand, in text-based IF games, we don't usually keep track of the player's
location <i>within</i> the room (just what room he's in).  But again, this makes
sense if we are doing back-end logic for a 3D graphical game (in which case the
3D engine can tell us the relative location of all the objects in the room,
including the player character).
</p>
<p>
In this usage, the XYZ absolute brick model provides an easy way to condense 3D
spatial information into a topological representation, and then expand that
information back out again when entering a 3D simulation (using the topology,
home locations, basic physics, and some fixed references in the room, it should
be easy to reconstruct a reasonable set of coordinates for objects left in a
room -- and this means we don't have to keep track of them all globally).
</p>

<h3>Room Topology</h3>
<p>
Another very common topology is "room topology".  PUB has a concept of "Doors" which
provides this in a very similar way to the brick model above, using essentially a
containment system. In this topology, rooms typically have doors associated with the
cardinal and mixed compass directions (N,NE,E,SE,S,SW,W,NW) plus "up" and "down", making
a total of ten common directions.

I understand and/or have planned at the moment. TJH 2006-2/13]
