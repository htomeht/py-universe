<h1>Localizing Games for PUB 2.x+</h1>

The internationalization/localization (I18N/L14N) concept for PUB allows a game to be written
once, then localized to many different languages. Game play is not (or shouldn't be) affected
by the choice of language in any strong way, so there's no need for a particular game to be
limited to the language of its author.
<p>
On the other hand, we have to have FIVE localization files working together to accomplish this
feat. The first THREE are within the game <i>ENGINE</i>, and can be summed up by saying that
"a PUB ENGINE localization is available for your language".  If you are trying to localize a
game, therefore, you must first make sure that an engine locale exists that you can use. You do
not strictly have to insist on a perfect match -- you could use a similar engine locale, and
operate in a "mixed locale" mode.  Even so, however, you will have to pick the engine locale
to use with your game locale.
</p>
<p>
The remaining two files are specific to the game, and consist of:
<ul>
<li>The Game MESSAGES file, which uses Gnu gettext, and...</li>
<li>The Game VOCABULARY file, which uses the same XML format as the ENGINE vocabulary (and
will be used to extend it).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
If you need to localize the game engine first, please see the <a href="l14n.html">PUB Localization</a>
notes.
