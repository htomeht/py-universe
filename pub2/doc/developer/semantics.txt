CONCEPT LANGUAGE in PUB

localized words
    When creating translations, must have a grammatical structure and
    a gloss for each universal concept.

    This is achieved through 5 files:

    First 3 are for the engine (=engine localization)
        locales/xx_VV.py    -- grammatical core locale for language xx,
                               optional variant VV, defines parsing
                               and telling functions for that language

        locales/xx_VV.xml   -- core vocabulary for locale

        locales/xx_VV.po    -- core messages for locale

    Last 2 are for the specific game (=game localization)
        game/xx_VV.xml      -- localized vocabulary for game

        game/xx_VV.po       -- localized messages for game
        
    
linguistic concepts ("bare symbols" or "labels")

    There must be a concept for every referrable object in
    the PUB universe, every linguistic concept, and every
    modifier or descriptive element. These concepts are
    universal, so they include a superset of known linguistic
    requirements (e.g. we include "4th person" because some
    languages have one, 6-part declension, because that's
    the maximum declension structure commonly found, etc).
    
    This is moderated by the limitation to the needs for
    describing present-tense statements, orders, questions,
    existential, and copular sentences which make sense
    with reference to the specific knowledge domain of the
    PUB universe.
    
    Basic set of concept symbols are defined in:

    semantics.py        -- basic grammatical structure
                            (modifiers, declension, tenses,
                            etc).

    nouns/basic.py      -- base set of noun components,
                           nouns, and adjectives
                           (For testing, demo games, etc)

    verbs/basic.py      -- base set of verbs and adverbs
                           (Many games can use only these)

    
semantic objects

    We have to define a number of objects whose function
    determines the basic laws of the PUB universe. So,
    for example, this is the level at which a "PUB Adjective"
    or a "PUB Noun" or "PUB Verb" exists. Unlike the
    linguistic concepts, they actually implement attributes
    and methods (either directly, or via dynamic components,
    as with nouns).

    semantics.py        -- NounPhrase and VerbPhrase objects,
                            AdjectiveVocabulary factory

    noun.py             -- DynamicComponentRack, Noun, Adjective classes

    verb.py             -- Verb, AdverbDomain, Adverb (factory object)
