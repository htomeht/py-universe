<h1>Goals for PUB 2</h1>
<p>
This is kind of a "TODO" list, but a bit more thought out (there is also a TODO list, if you
just want to change that).  If you have something you think is important to put into PUB2, or
at least that we need to consider it, lets put it here:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Internationalization</dt>
<dd>
We should be able to have a completely internationalized core, so that it's possible to write
a game in one language, then, with minimal fuss, translate it so it can be played in many
languages. The effort needed to localize a <i>game</i> shouldn't be much worse than using
gettext is for most programs. Internationalizing the IF engine itself is trickier, but I
have a working model, which is partly outlined in these developer documents. I'm going to
be seriously overhauling the <tt>parser</tt> module as a result.
</dd>

<dt>Normalizing to Modern Python</dt>
<dd>
There has been some weird stuff in PUB, largely dating from very old Python versions. For
example, it once had its own simple templating system for interpolation of words. Since
then, Python has acquired a native syntax for this. Likewise, PUB used to use specialized
helper functions like "cap(x)" to capitalize a string, but modern python tends to use
string methods "x.capitalize()". Normalizing these things to modern conventions should make
the code easier for developers to read.
</dd>

<dt>Object Database?</dt>
<dd>
I have only recently figured out how PUB handles save and restore of games. Basically, the "pub"
module is being used as an "object database". However, Python modules weren't really designed
to be object databases, and using them will put some arbitrary limits on us (as well as creating
some awkwardness in the import ordering within PUB).  I think we ought to seriously consider
replacing "pub" with a ZODB (Zope Object Database). It should be nearly a drop-in replacement,
and it should make the save format more stable, provide more support for client-server mode,
and a number of other conveniences. The only obstacle I see is the need to incorporate Zope-style
"persistent" classes which extend mutable objects like list and dict.
</dd>

<dt>Interaction with "Universe"</dt>
<dd>
I am also working on a graphical "interactive cinema" engine, which will use PUB as its
primary game logic engine.  This requires a bit of thought on the PUB side, and is the
motivation for a number of minor changes:
<ul>
<li>Adding "brick model" (or "XYZ-sort") topology</li>
<li>Vocabulary and context/scope checking to support a "sentence widget"</li>
<li>Zope-like acquisition of object "resources" based on topological position and context</li>
<li>Game instance framework for complex game creation.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Turn-based Scheduling</dt>
<dd>
I find it odd that PUB currently only provides a real-time scheduler, despite the fact
that game play is essentially turn-based. A turn-based scheduler is a very simple extension
of the existing code.
</dd>

<dt>XML Authoring Tools</dt>
<dd>
Although PUB will always be programmable in Python, and most games of any complexity
will probably require python coding, I think it would be desireable to provide
support for an XML language for describing simple aspects of a game, such as:
<ul>
<li>Tools for creating massive topological maps of rooms using an XML format.</li>
<li>Hack <a href="http://xcircuit.sf.net">xcircuit</a> to create the XML from a
graphical environment. I actually had something like this working once, using xcircuit's
schematic capture and netlisting tools, so I think I can get it to work again.</li>
<li>Simple noun creation from existing classes, and initial placement.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>PyProtocols: Interface / Component / Adapters</dt>
<dd>
Interfaces provide a much better-controlled expression of the relationships between world-model
objects, as well as other objects within PUB. Using them will make the code more self-documenting.
</dd>

<dt>Unit tests with Py-Unit</dt>
<dd>
Well, we're doing a lot of re-development, so this is a good time to add unit tests
wherever we can figure out to put them.  Unit tests add time to your initial writing
and conceptualizing process, but they usually save <i>massive</i> amounts of time in
the debugging phase. They also encourage more understanding of the code as you work
on it.
</dd>

<dt>Use Interfaces to do Noun "Pre-Checks"</dt>
<dd>
Interfaces are also a natural way for a verb to check if a given noun makes sense as an object.
</dd>

<dt>Replace Post-/Pre- Checks with Exception-Based Code</dt>
<dd>
Instead of using the existing pre-check and post-check system, use simple dispatching. Nouns
will raise exceptions if there is a problem. Otherwise execution will return with values to
be reported.
</dd>

<dt>More Objects to Play With</dt>
<dd>
Lots more noun and noun-components, allowing more complex objects to be created easily.
</dd>

<dt>New Example Games</dt>
<dd>
I'd like to write a "Cloak of Darkness" game. Many IF authors regard this as a "hello world"
standard program to test IF engines with.  PUB should at least provide an implementation. I'd
also like to re-implement the one-room "Through the Looking Glass" puzzle from the Inform
tutorial.  Then I'd like to make a less-trivial example, with perhaps a dozen rooms and various
objects and characters to interact with.  We need some more serious tests.
</dd>

<h1>Dependencies</h1>
<p>
Naturally this work has added some dependencies:

<h5>Runtime Dependencies</h5>
<ul>
<li>PyProtocols</li>
<li>ZODB</li>
<li>py-unit</li>
</ul>

<h5>Documentation Build Dependencies</h5>
<ul>
<li>Dia</li>
<li>Inkscape</li>
<li>epydoc</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you add a dependency (or think of one), be sure
to update this list so we all know what's going on.
