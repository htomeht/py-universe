<h1>Rooms, Places, and Doors in PUB 2.x+</h1>
Rooms have a special significance in IF games, because they are the underpinnings of the entire
world that an IF game takes place in. Internally to the engine, they are like any other container,
but their wide range of uses implies that we ought to have some special tools to make management
of rooms easier.

[I want to eventually create an XML spec for drawing up large room topologies, and a tool for generating
them from graphics -- basically recovering what I did in xcircuit at one time on The Light Princess
project.  There's also the matter of linking between IF rooms and 3D game representations of
them in Universe games].
