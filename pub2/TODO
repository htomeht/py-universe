* Provide interface definitions in interfaces.py (instead of just intent)

* Provide implementations in components.py

* Change 'BaseThing' to 'Noun'

(2006/01)

* convert documentation to use epydoc

* complete BaseThing->Noun conversion

* make interpolation engine use Python dict interpolation so <The dirobj> becomes %(dirobj)s
  this will reduce confusion for new developers (we don't really need a custom templating engine)

* get rid of manual implementation checks to determine if a verb can act on a noun. Instead,
  use PyProtocols and exception handling. Every verb identifies an interface for dobj and
  multiple for iobj.
