DO NOT ATTEMPT TO WRITE A GAME WITH THIS RELEASE!

This is "discussion" release (not even a "pre-alpha"),
which does not actually work. My goal was to get the
basic directory and file-structure right, and then
start getting the developer documentation tree to
build.

The main reason for releasing this, instead of just
pulling the work from the CVS, is that I have pre-
built the documentation tree, so that developers
don't have to download and install dia, inkscape,
and epydoc and try to build the documentation as
I have done it, just to discuss the project (I'm
hoping this will encourage more people to read it).

Some of the goals of the layout you see:

* New approach to internationalization and new,
  pyparsing-based parser to support it.

* PyProtocols-based interface/component/adapter
  architecture.

* "Plugin" structure for Verbs and Nouns to make
  PUB extensions more atomic.

* Best-of-both-worlds automatically generated API
  documentation with static developer notes and
  overview pages added.
